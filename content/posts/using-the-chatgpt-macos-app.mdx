Openai rolling out the macOS app to Plus users starting today, and we will make it more broadly available in the coming weeks. We also plan to launch a Windows version later this year.

> System Requirements: MacOS 14 and Apple Silicon (M1 or better)

For both free and paid users, we have launched a new ChatGPT desktop app for macOS that is designed to integrate seamlessly into anything you’re doing on your computer.
​

With a simple keyboard shortcut (Option + Space), you can instantly ask ChatGPT a question. Learn more about accessing the launcher on the MacOS app.

You can also take and discuss screenshots and directly in the app. Learn more about how to take a screenshot with the MacOS app.

The app also enables you to start new conversations with photos from your computer, or new photos you take.

You can now have voice conversations with ChatGPT directly from your computer, starting with Voice Mode that has been available in ChatGPT at launch, with GPT-4o’s new audio and video capabilities coming in the future. Whether you want to brainstorm a new idea for your company, prepare for an interview or have a topic you’d like to discuss, tap the headphone icon in the bottom right corner of the desktop app to start a voice conversation.
